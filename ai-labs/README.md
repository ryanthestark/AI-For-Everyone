# AI Labs

Welcome to the **AI Labs** section - your hands-on experimentation space for learning AI through practical, guided exercises!

## 🎯 What Are AI Labs?

AI Labs are structured, hands-on exercises that guide you through real-world AI tasks using free tools. Each lab is a complete learning experience where you'll:

* Accomplish a specific, practical goal
* Use AI tools in a guided, safe environment
* Learn through doing, not just reading
* Build confidence with real applications
* Develop critical thinking about AI capabilities

Think of this as your "science lab" for AI - a place to experiment, learn, and build skills through practice.
