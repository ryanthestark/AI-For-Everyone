## 🚀 Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Prepare Your Information (Time: 3-5 minutes)

**Objective:** Gather the information you need to create an effective study plan

**Instructions:**

1. **Choose your subject or topic**
   * Be specific: "Algebra 1" is better than "math"
   * Example: "Spanish vocabulary for travel," "Biology - Cell Structure," "Python programming basics"

2. **Determine your timeframe**
   * How long until your test, project, or goal?
   * How much time can you study each day/week?
   * Example: "2 weeks, 30 minutes per day"

3. **Identify your goals**
   * What do you want to achieve?
   * Example: "Pass the midterm exam," "Have basic conversation skills," "Build a simple program"

4. **Know your starting level**
   * Complete beginner, some experience, or reviewing?
   * Example: "I know basic vocab but struggle with verb conjugation"

**Example Setup:**
```
Subject: World History - World War II
Timeframe: 10 days, 45 minutes per day
Goal: Score 85% or higher on upcoming test
Starting level: Completed reading assignments but need to review and organize notes
```

**Tips:**
* 💡 The more specific you are, the better the AI can help
* ⚠️ Don't share personal details like your school name or teacher's name

**Checkpoint:** ✅ You have a clear subject, timeframe, goal, and starting level written down

---

### Step 2: Create Your Initial Prompt (Time: 3-5 minutes)

**Objective:** Write an effective prompt that provides the AI with the context it needs

**Instructions:**

1. **Open your chosen AI tool**
   * Go to [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com) or [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
   * Sign in to your free account

2. **Write a detailed prompt using this structure:**

```
I need help creating a study plan. Here's my situation:

Subject: [Your specific subject/topic]
Timeframe: [How many days/weeks and time per day]
Goal: [What you want to achieve]
Current level: [Your starting point]
Learning style: [If you know it - visual, hands-on, reading, etc.]

Please create a day-by-day study plan that breaks down what I should focus on each session.
```

3. **Customize with additional details** (optional but helpful):
   * Specific topics you need to cover
   * Areas where you struggle
   * Resources you have (textbook, notes, videos)
   * Preferred study methods

**Example Prompt:**

```
I need help creating a study plan. Here's my situation:

Subject: Biology - Cell Structure and Function
Timeframe: 12 days, 40 minutes per day (Monday-Friday, 1 hour on weekends)
Goal: Understand all cell organelles, their functions, and how they work together
Current level: I've read the chapter once but I'm confused about the differences between plant and animal cells
Learning style: I learn best with diagrams and by making flashcards

Please create a day-by-day study plan that breaks down what I should focus on each session. Include specific topics for each day and suggest study activities.
```

**Tips:**
* 💡 Be honest about your current level - the AI can't help if it doesn't know where you're starting
* 💡 Mention any upcoming quizzes or tests so the plan can build toward them
* ⚠️ Avoid sharing your specific school, class schedule, or teacher names

**Checkpoint:** ✅ You have a complete prompt ready to send to the AI

---

### Step 3: Submit Your Prompt and Review the Response (Time: 3-5 minutes)

**Objective:** Get your initial study plan and evaluate its quality

**Instructions:**

1. **Send your prompt to the AI**
   * Paste or type your prompt into the chat
   * Press Enter or click Send

2. **Wait for the complete response**
   * The AI will take 10-30 seconds to generate the plan
   * Let it finish completely before responding

3. **Review the study plan carefully**
   * Does it cover all the topics you need?
   * Is the daily breakdown realistic for your schedule?
   * Are the suggested activities helpful?
   * Does it match your learning style?

4. **Take notes on what to adjust**
   * Too much material per day?
   * Missing important topics?
   * Activities that won't work for you?
   * Need more detail or less detail?

**Example AI Response (abbreviated):**

```
Here's your 12-day Biology study plan:

Day 1 (40 min): Introduction to Cell Theory
- Read textbook section on cell discovery
- Watch 10-minute video on cell theory basics
- Create a simple timeline of cell biology discoveries

Day 2 (40 min): Cell Membrane & Transport
- Review cell membrane structure
- Learn active vs passive transport
- Make flashcards for key terms: osmosis, diffusion, etc.

[... continues with Days 3-12 ...]

Day 12 (60 min): Review & Practice Test
- Quick review of all flashcards
- Take practice quiz on all topics
- Focus extra time on weak areas
```

**Tips:**
* 💡 The first version is rarely perfect - that's normal!
* 💡 Look for a good balance between review and new learning
* ⚠️ If the plan seems too advanced or too basic, you'll need to adjust in the next step

**Checkpoint:** ✅ You've received a complete study plan and identified what needs adjustment

---

### Step 4: Refine Your Study Plan (Time: 5-10 minutes)

**Objective:** Iterate with the AI to improve the plan to perfectly fit your needs

**Instructions:**

1. **Ask for specific adjustments**
   * Use follow-up prompts in the same conversation
   * Be specific about what to change

2. **Example refinement prompts:**

```
"This looks good, but Day 3 has too much material. Can you break it into 2 days?"
```

```
"I don't have access to videos. Can you replace video activities with reading and diagram-drawing instead?"
```

```
"Can you add more practice problems on Days 7-9? I need more hands-on practice."
```

```
"This is great! Can you also create a list of key terms I should know for each topic?"
```

3. **Continue refining until satisfied**
   * You can ask multiple follow-up questions
   * Each response builds on the previous conversation
   * The AI remembers the context

4. **Common adjustments to request:**
   * Adjust time per day
   * Add or remove topics
   * Change activity types
   * Add practice questions
   * Include review sessions
   * Create study resources (flashcard lists, practice questions)

**Example Refinement Conversation:**

```
You: "This is helpful! But I actually have a quiz on Day 6 covering Days 1-5 material. 
Can you adjust the plan so Days 4-5 focus on reviewing the early topics?"

AI: "Absolutely! Here's the revised plan with Days 4-5 focused on review before your quiz..."

You: "Perfect! Can you also create a 20-question practice quiz covering Days 1-5 
material that I can use to prepare?"

AI: "Of course! Here's a 20-question practice quiz..."
```

**Tips:**
* 💡 Don't be afraid to ask for changes - the AI is there to help you
* 💡 You can ask for study resources like flashcards, quiz questions, or summaries
* 💡 Request different formats: checklists, calendars, or simple lists
* ⚠️ Remember the AI doesn't know your specific textbook content - use it for structure and organization

**Checkpoint:** ✅ You have a study plan that fits your schedule, learning style, and goals

3. **Make adjustments as needed:**
   * Go back to the AI if you need to modify the plan
   * Example: "I finished Day 3 material in 25 minutes instead of 40. Can you suggest additional practice for the extra time?"
   * Example: "Day 5's material was harder than expected. Can you break it into 2 days?"

4. **Use the AI for ongoing support:**
   * Ask for explanations of confusing concepts
   * Request practice problems
   * Get quiz question suggestions
   * Find additional resources

**Example Ongoing Prompts:**

```
"I'm on Day 4 of my study plan and I'm struggling with understanding active transport. 
Can you explain it in a simpler way with a real-world analogy?"
```

```
"I finished Days 1-6 faster than planned. Can you suggest advanced practice activities 
for the extra time I have?"
```

**Tips:**
* 💡 Your study plan is a guide, not a rigid rule - adapt as you learn
* 💡 Come back to the AI whenever you hit a roadblock
