### 1. Complete a Research Paper (Multi-day)

**Scenario:** Write a 5-page research paper on renewable energy, due in 2 weeks.

**Tools:** ChatGPT, Google Scholar, GitHub Projects

**Process:**
1. **Day 1-2:** Topic exploration and narrowing
2. **Day 3-4:** Research and source collection
3. **Day 5-7:** Outline and drafting
4. **Day 8-10:** Writing and revision
5. **Day 11-12:** Editing and formatting
6. **Day 13-14:** Final review and submission

**Sample Prompt (Day 1):**
```
I need to write a 5-page research paper for high school environmental science.

Topic area: Renewable energy
Requirements:
- 5 pages, double-spaced
- 5-7 academic sources
- Compare 2-3 renewable energy types
- Environmental impact analysis

Help me:
1. Narrow this to a specific research question
2. Create an outline structure
3. Suggest types of sources to find
4. Make a 2-week timeline
```

### 2. Prepare for a Math Test (1 week)

**Scenario:** Algebra test covering linear equations, due Friday.

**Tools:** ChatGPT, Photomath, practice notebook

**Process:**
1. **Monday:** Review concepts, identify weak areas
2. **Tuesday:** Practice basic problems
3. **Wednesday:** Tackle harder problems
4. **Thursday:** Mixed practice, timing
5. **Friday:** Quick review, take test

**Sample Prompt (Monday):**
```
I have an Algebra 1 test Friday on:
- Solving linear equations
- Graphing lines
- Slope-intercept form
- Systems of equations

I'm confident with basic solving but struggle with:
- Word problems
- Systems of equations

Create a study plan for Monday-Thursday with:
- Daily focus topics (30-45 min/day)
- Practice problem types
- How to review on Friday morning
```

### 3. Understand a Difficult Concept (1 hour)

**Scenario:** Can't understand photosynthesis from textbook.

**Tools:** ChatGPT

**Process:**
1. Ask for simple explanation
2. Request analogy
3. Get step-by-step breakdown
4. Ask follow-up questions
5. Request practice questions
6. Check understanding

**Sample Prompt:**
```
I'm a 7th grader learning about photosynthesis. The textbook is confusing.

Please explain:
