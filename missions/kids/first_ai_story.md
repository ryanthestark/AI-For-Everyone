## 📖 Step-by-Step Mission Guide

### Step 1: Say Hello (2 minutes)

First, let's introduce ourselves to the AI!

**Type this (or something like it)**:
```
Hello! I'm [your name] and I'm ready to create a story!
```

**What to notice**: How does the AI respond? Is it friendly?

---

### Step 2: Start Your Story (3 minutes)

Now, let's ask the AI to begin your story!

**Try typing**:
```
Tell me a story about a brave knight exploring a magical forest.
```

**What happened?** Did the AI start a story? What did it say?

**Parent Discussion Point**: Talk about how the AI followed your instructions. Did it understand what you wanted?

---

### Step 3: Add Details (5 minutes)

Let's make the story more interesting by asking the AI to add details!

**Try these prompts** (one at a time):
- "What does the magical forest look like?"
- "What special powers does the knight have?"
- "Tell me about something mysterious in the forest"
- "What friendly creature does the knight meet?"

**Exploration Challenge**: Which prompt gave you the most interesting response?

### Step 4: Create an Adventure (5 minutes)

Every good story needs an adventure! Let's add one.

**Try asking**:
- "What challenge does the knight face in the forest?"
- "Tell me about a puzzle the knight needs to solve"
- "What happens when the knight finds a mysterious door?"

**Think About It**: How does the AI come up with these ideas? Is it being creative, or following patterns?

---

### Step 5: Make It Your Own (5 minutes)

Now it's YOUR turn to be creative! Come up with your own questions to continue the story.

**Ideas to try**:
- Change the ending
- Add a new character
- Create a plot twist
- Ask about what happens next

**Creative Bonus**: Can you ask a question that surprises the AI?
