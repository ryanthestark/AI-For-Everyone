## ✅ Workflow Best Practices

**Using workflows:**
* ✅ Read completely before starting
* ✅ Don't skip steps (at first)
* ✅ Check off as you go
* ✅ Note what works for you
* ✅ Adapt after multiple uses

**Creating workflows:**
* ✅ Test multiple times
* ✅ Document variations
* ✅ Include time estimates
* ✅ Note common issues
* ✅ Explain the why, not just what

## 💡 Example Workflow Snippet

**Homework Completion Workflow - Step 3**

### Step 3: Break Down the Assignment

**Action:** Divide the homework into smaller tasks

**Details:**
1. Read the assignment completely
2. Identify distinct parts or questions
3. Estimate time for each part
4. Order tasks by difficulty or dependency

**Tips:**
* Start with what you understand best
* Break big questions into sub-questions
* Use AI to help identify steps if stuck

**Output:** 
A task list with time estimates

**Checkpoint:**
✓ Each task is clear and specific
✓ Time estimates total less than available time
✓ No task seems overwhelming
