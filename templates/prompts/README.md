## 📖 Template Anatomy

Good prompts include:

```

**2. Task**
```
Please explain [concept] in simple terms.
```

**3. Requirements**
```
- Use analogies and examples
- Avoid technical jargon
- Check my understanding with questions
```

**4. Format**
```
Structure your explanation as:

```

## ✅ Prompt Template Best Practices

**Do:**
* ✅ Be specific about what you want
* ✅ Provide relevant context
* ✅ Specify the format you need
* ✅ Include your level/background
* ✅ Ask for verification or examples

**Don't:**
* ❌ Be too vague ("help me with math")
* ❌ Forget to specify your level
* ❌ Ask for too many things at once
* ❌ Assume AI knows your context
* ❌ Accept first response without iteration

## 💡 Example: Before and After

**Before (Vague):**
```
Tell me about photosynthesis
```

**After (Using Template):**
```
You are a biology tutor explaining concepts to a 7th-grade student.

Please explain photosynthesis in simple terms.

Requirements:
- Use a real-world analogy
- Explain the inputs and outputs
- Avoid complex chemistry terms
- Include a simple diagram description

Format:
1. One-sentence summary
2. Analogy to everyday life
3. Step-by-step process
4. Why it matters
5. A question to check my understanding
```

## 🌟 Tips for Better Prompts

**Be specific:**
* "Explain algebra" → "Explain solving for x in linear equations"
* "Help with essay" → "Help me outline a 5-paragraph persuasive essay"

**Add context:**
* Include your knowledge level
* Mention any constraints (time, length)
* Specify your goal

**Request format:**
* Bullet points vs. paragraphs
* Step-by-step vs. summary
* With examples vs. theory only

**Iterate:**
* First response not quite right? Ask for adjustments
* "Make it simpler"
* "Add more examples"
* "Focus on [specific aspect]"
