## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Won't my kids think I don't trust them?**
A: Frame it as **safety**, not surveillance. "We have rules and checks to keep you safe online, just like seatbelts in the car."

**Q: What if my kids find ways around the controls?**
A: Have a conversation, not a punishment. Explain WHY controls exist. If they're curious and problem-solving, channel it positively!

**Q: How do I balance safety and independence?**
A: Increase independence gradually. Ages 7-8 = high supervision. Ages 11-12 = more trust but still monitoring. By 13+, focus on open communication.

**Q: My parental controls keep drifting out of compliance. Help!**
A: Set monthly calendar reminder to verify settings. iOS Screen Time passcode helps prevent changes. Family Link can be managed remotely.

**Q: Should I monitor everything they do?**
A: Balance! Weekly spot checks > constant surveillance. Build trust while maintaining safety.

**Q: What if I make a mistake with the settings?**
A: That's okay! This is learning for parents too. Adjust as you go.
