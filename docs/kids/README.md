## 💡 Key Principles

### 1. Safety First, Always
Parental controls and supervision are non-negotiable. Setup before access.

### 2. Start Where You Are
Don't wait for perfect setup. Use existing devices and build from there.

### 3. Learn Together
Parents don't need to be experts—curiosity and guidance matter most.

### 4. Age-Appropriate Supervision
- Ages 7-8: High (parent in same room)
- Ages 9-10: Moderate (parent nearby)
- Ages 11-12: Light (parent available, weekly reviews)

### 5. Progress Over Perfection
Every family moves at their own pace. Adapt to your child's needs.

### 6. AI Is a Tool, Not Magic
Teach critical thinking. AI makes mistakes. Always verify facts.

### 7. Celebrate Small Wins
Completed first prompt? Celebrate! Finished project? Celebrate! Learning is happening!
