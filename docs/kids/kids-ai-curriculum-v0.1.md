- ChatGPT helping with homework
- Netflix suggesting shows

❌ **NOT AI:**
- A calculator (it just does math)

- A timer or alarm clock

**Discussion**: "AI learns from lots of information and makes decisions. A calculator just follows one rule!"

**Activity 2: First AI Conversation (15 min)**

**Parent & child together:**
1. Open ChatGPT or Google Gemini
2. Type together: "Hello! I'm [child's first name] and I'm learning about AI. Can you explain what AI is for a [age]-year-old?"

**Bad Prompt**: "Tell me about dogs"
- What happens: AI gives a VERY long, boring answer

**Good Prompt**: "Tell me 3 fun facts about dogs for a [age]-year-old"
- What happens: Short, interesting answer!

**Bad Prompt**: "Story"
- What happens: AI confused or gives random story

**Good Prompt**: "Write a short story about a brave cat who saves the day"

| "Help with math" | "Explain how to add fractions like I'm 8 years old" |
| "Write something" | "Write a funny poem about my dog" |

**The Magic Words:**
- "For a [age]-year-old"
- "In simple words"
- "Give me 3 examples"
- "Make it short and fun"

**Activity 3: Challenge Round (10 min)**

"Ask AI to help you with something YOU want to know!"

Examples:
