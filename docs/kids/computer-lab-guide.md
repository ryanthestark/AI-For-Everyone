## 🎯 Decision Helper

**Not sure which tier to choose? Answer these questions:**

1. **How many kids will use this?** 
   - 1 kid = Tier 2-3 often enough
   - 2+ kids = Aim for Tier 3 or hot-swappable Tier 2

2. **What's your budget reality?**
   - $0 = Tier 1 (make it work!)
   - $150-400 = Tier 2 (smart investments)
   - $400-900 = Tier 3 (ideal learning setup)
   - $1000+ = Tier 4 (dream setup)

3. **How long will you use this?**
   - 1-2 years = Tier 1-2
   - 3-5 years = Tier 3
   - 5+ years = Tier 4

4. **What's your tech comfort level?**
   - Beginner parent = Tier 1-2, stick with familiar OS
   - Intermediate = Any tier, explore options
   - Advanced = Tier 4, customize everything

**Still stuck? Start with Tier 1 for 1 month, then upgrade if needed!**

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can my old 2015 laptop work for this?**
A: Probably! As long as it runs a modern browser and has 4GB+ RAM, try it first.

**Q: Do I need to buy new devices if I have tablets?**
A: No! Tablets work great for kids 7-12. Add a bluetooth keyboard ($20-30) for better typing.

**Q: Is Mac really better than Windows/Chromebook for kids?**
A: Not necessarily "better"—it depends on your family. Macs have excellent parental controls and longevity, but Chromebooks are more affordable and Windows has more software. Choose what YOU can manage.

**Q: My kids break everything. Should I buy cheap devices?**
A: Balance! Super-cheap devices frustrate kids (slow = not learning). Consider refurbished quality devices + protective cases.

**Q: Can they share one computer?**
A: Yes! Use separate user accounts and a schedule. 30-60 min blocks work well.

**Q: What about game consoles or smart TVs?**
A: These aren't ideal for AI learning—no keyboard, limited browsers. Stick with computers/tablets.
