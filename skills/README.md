### Skill 2: Basic LLM Evaluation

Learn how to systematically evaluate and compare different Large Language Models (LLMs), especially free and low-cost options.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set up a simple evaluation environment
- How to test LLMs with consistent prompts
- How to compare responses and document findings
- How to work with free-tier APIs and local models

**Resources:**
- [LLM Evaluation Directory](../experiments/llm_evaluation/)
- [Evaluation Methodology](../experiments/llm_evaluation/README.md)
- [First Comparison Results](../experiments/llm_evaluation/results_comparison_1.md)

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic computer skills (no programming experience required to read results)
- Python knowledge helpful but not required (for running evaluations)

**Time Commitment:** 30-60 minutes to review and understand the evaluation process

**Why This Matters:**
With so many AI tools available, it's important to understand:
- Which free options exist
- How to compare them fairly
- What trade-offs different models have
- How to make informed decisions about which tools to use
