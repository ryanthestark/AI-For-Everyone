# Experiments Directory

## Welcome to the Experimentation Lab

This is your space to explore, test, and compare AI tools and capabilities! The **Experimentation Lab** is designed to:

- **Explore** new AI tools and models as they emerge
- **Compare** different approaches to the same task
- **Test** AI capabilities and limitations
- **Document** findings for the community
- **Learn** through hands-on experimentation

## Purpose

The Experimentation Lab serves as a testbed for:

1. **Tool Comparisons** - How do different AI tools handle the same prompt?
2. **Capability Testing** - What can AI do well? What are its limitations?
3. **Prompt Engineering** - What prompting techniques work best?
4. **Model Evaluation** - Comparing free and open-source models
5. **Use Case Exploration** - Finding new applications for AI

## Guiding Principles

Our experiments follow these principles:

- **Free & Accessible** - Focus on free or low-cost tools
- **Transparent** - Document methods, results, and limitations
- **Reproducible** - Others should be able to recreate experiments
- **Educational** - Experiments should teach something valuable
- **Ethical** - Consider implications and responsible use

## How Experiments Are Documented

Each experiment in this directory includes:

- **Objective** - What are we trying to learn?
- **Tools Used** - Which AI tools/models were tested
- **Method** - Step-by-step process
- **Results** - What we discovered
- **Analysis** - What does it mean?
- **Limitations** - What couldn't we test or determine?
- **Reproducibility** - How others can run the same experiment

## Types of Experiments

### Tool Comparisons
Compare how different AI tools respond to the same prompts or tasks.

### Capability Testing
Push AI tools to their limits to understand what they can and cannot do.

### Prompt Engineering
Test different prompting strategies to improve results.

### Model Benchmarking
Compare performance of different models on specific tasks.

### Real-World Applications
Test AI tools on practical, everyday tasks.

### Experiment 1: Comparing Free LLM Prompts

**Status:** Coming Soon

**Objective:** Compare how different free Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to the same set of prompts across various task types.

**Tools to Test:**
- ChatGPT (free tier)
- Claude (free tier)
- Google Gemini (free tier)
- Other free LLM options

**Task Categories:**
- Creative writing
- Technical explanations
- Summarization
- Problem-solving
- Code generation

**Method:**
1. Create a standardized set of prompts across categories
2. Submit identical prompts to each LLM
3. Document responses
4. Compare quality, accuracy, and usefulness
5. Note any unique capabilities or limitations

**Success Criteria:**
- Document responses from at least 3 different LLMs
- Identify strengths and weaknesses of each
- Provide recommendations for different use cases
- Create reproducible test methodology

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Understanding which free tools work best for different tasks
- Practical guidance for tool selection
- Template for future LLM comparisons

## Safety & Ethics

When experimenting with AI:
- ✅ Use free or low-cost tools
- ✅ Respect terms of service
- ✅ Protect privacy (don't share personal data)
- ✅ Document limitations and biases
- ✅ Consider ethical implications

- ❌ Don't use proprietary data without permission
- ❌ Don't test harmful or inappropriate use cases
- ❌ Don't violate any tool's terms of service
- ❌ Don't make claims without evidence
